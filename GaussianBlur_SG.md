## Description Features

A GaussianBlur effect for **GameObjects (meshes)**

* Adjust Blur, Lightness, Saturation, and TintColor 
* Made using Unity's ShaderGraph
* Compatible with Unity's Scriptable Rendering Pipelines 
  


## Requirements

Below are the list of packages i'm using.  
Using the exact version is recommended, but might not be required.

* Unity 2019.1.4
* Core RP Library 5.13.0
* Lightweight RP 5.13.0
* Shader Graph 5.13.0


## How To Use GaussianBlur_SG

### Set Up

#### Use Package Manager
Use the package manager to obtain 
* Lightweight RP
* Shader Graph

#### place LWRP_forGaussianBlur in Project Settings
This will tell the project how to render our project

**note that LWRP_forGaussianBlur has some custom data.**
LWRP_GaussianBlurredObjects contains instructions on how to blur the objects.  
Therefore, if you decide to merge this asset with other custom renderers we'll need to change this.

#### Add BlurMaterial_SG to objects

#### Change the Object's Layer to "GaussianBlur"

### Misc Info

In LWRP the camera automatically creates a texture of the scene. Whoever this might not work if you are using transparent shaders in your scene. The solution would be to use a render texture, as an alternative texture in the GaussianBlur_SG_RT.shader.

Please see the Demo_SG_RenderTexture.unity to see it in action.
  
## Demos

### Demo_SG.unity
displays the material while using the CameraOpaqueTexture from the LWRP

### Demo_SG_RenderTexture.unity
displays the material while using a RenderTexture from a camera

A camera has a target texture set to a RenderedTexture. That RenderedTexture is then used in a Shader Graph Shader to produce the blur effect on the screen.
