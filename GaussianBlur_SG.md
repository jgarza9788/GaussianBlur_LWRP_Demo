**note that LWRP_forGaussianBlur has some custom data.**
LWRP_GaussianBlurredObjects contains instructions on how to blur the objects.  
Therefore, if you decide to merge this asset with other custom renderers we'll need to change this.

#### Tag Objects with "GaussianBlur" and they will render using this custom shader.


### Misc Info

1. BlurShader_11x11.shader **Deprecated**
    * this used many shader graph nodes to create the blurred effect, and your computer might freeze on opening it (this will be removed in future versions of the asset) 
2. BlurShader_CN.shader 
    * this uses a custom node in shader graph.
